NETWORKING Commands 
****************************************
“/etc/hostname stores the system hostname,
/etc/hosts maps hostnames to IPs locally,
 and /etc/resolv.conf defines DNS servers for name resolution.”
----------------------------------------------------
Check Ip address
ip a         Check Ip address
ifconfig  
hostname  
ip addr
ip Link 👉 Check network interface status (UP/DOWN) 
ip route > check default gateway
-------------------
ping   > Check Network connectivity between two servers
telnet & nc -zv > Are used to check if port is open on a given ip address 

Only differnce is That telnet opens a Session , which nc -zv just check connectivity
--------------------
View routing table

route -n 
netstat -rn
ip route show Check default gateway 

-----------------
check open ports (PORT & SERVICE CHECKS (INTERVIEW FAVORITE))

netstate -tunlp 
ss -tunlp
lsof -i :22 Find which process is using a port

dig and nslookup are DNS command-line tools used to query DNS servers. Both perform the same basic function, but dig is more advanced than nslookup.

CONNECTION & PATH DEBUGGING

curl http://localhost Test HTTP/HTTPS connectivity

wget http://example.com Download test + connectivity check

traceroute google.com

is a command used to check the path and delay (hops) that packets takes to reach destination

tracepath  google.com  

does not need root access else both are same

iftop -i eth0 
is a real time command line tool used to monitor bandwidth usage on network interface
---------------------------------

ifup eth0
ifdown eth0 


--------------------
ethtool eth0

“ethtool eth0 is used to check the physical link status and speed of a network interface.”

Physical link status means whether the network cable and network card have an actual electrical connection.

ss -s  > Network statistics
