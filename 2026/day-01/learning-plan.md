Consistency Approach

I will keep my learning practical and realistic. Even on busy days, I’ll make sure to do something small—reading, practicing commands, or fixing an error. Progress every day matters more than perfection.

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

Honestly, I see DevOps and Cloud as a way to make things easier and more reliable. DevOps is about developers and operations working together instead of separately, so work doesn’t get stuck. Cloud makes it easier to build and manage systems without worrying about physical servers. Together, they help teams move faster and avoid a lot of manual effort.

2️⃣ Why did you start learning DevOps & Cloud?

I started learning DevOps and Cloud because I genuinely enjoy working with Linux and systems. I like fixing things, setting up servers, and understanding how everything works in the background. When I came across DevOps, it just felt like something that matched my interest and mindset, not something I was forcing myself to learn.

3️⃣ Where do you want to reach?

I want to reach a point where I’m confident handling real systems without panic. I want to understand things end to end and be trusted to manage and troubleshoot production issues. Over time, I want to grow into a strong DevOps engineer who knows what they’re doing and can guide others too.

4️⃣ How will you stay consistent every single day?

I stay consistent by keeping things simple. I don’t try to do too much at once. Even if it’s just 30 minutes a day, I make sure I learn or practice something. Small daily effort keeps me moving forward, and once it becomes a habit, consistency doesn’t feel forced.
